###Agenda

In this hands-on session you will run two labs to automate the workflow of two basic Machine Learning examples using Kubeflow pipelines and SageMaker components:  
1. k-means classification of the MNIST dataset
1. image classifiction of the cifar10 dataset using CNNs

After we've run these labs, you will also have the chance to try out the newly announced SageMaker Pipelines and Feature Store. 
The following is a rough time schedule. Questions can be asked throughout the session.
